        <label for="id_title" class="lead">About this site</label>
        <p>This site started first as an experiment in learning python. I thought I'd create a site on which to 
        grow my learning in python, which could serve double duty as a place to share my musings about "<a href="{% url 'healthspan' %}">healthspan</a>"
        and related topics.</p>

        <p>Born in 1958, a beneficiary of lively, positive family circumstances, now, short of finding myself trumped by random catastrophe, I think I have a reasonable chance to hack my way into a healthy healthspan of 100 years, a nice round number. That would be fun, I think, and something worth a good try. Worth a good try because failing health seems quite unattractive to me, and likely more expensive, to boot.</p>

        <p>My challenge is to see what I can do in these <strong>{{ days }} days</strong> remaining until my 100th b-day. That would be about <strong>{{ weeks }} weeks</strong>, or about <strong>{{ months }} solar months</strong>, ({{ lunar_months }} lunar months), or roughly <strong>{{ years }} years</strong>; and which would be about <strong>{{ mars_years }} mars years</strong> (at 668.6 sols/mars year).</p>

        <p>My wife, Heidi, and I became as-married at Beijing University about <strong>{{ fm_since_uc_married }} full moons</strong> ago, which we officialized on a full moon day with family and friends <strong>{{ fm_since_of_married }} full moons</strong> ago. That would be <strong>{{ bm_since_of_married }} blue moons</strong> past.</p>

        <p> These are lunarversaries we have to look forward to during the next year.</p>

        <label for="id_title" class="lead">About this site</label>
        <p>This site started first as an experiment in learning python. I thought I'd create a site on which to 
        grow my learning in python, which could serve double duty as a place to share my musings about "<a href="{% url 'healthspan' %}">healthspan</a>"
        and related topics.</p>

        <p>Born in 1958, a beneficiary of lively, positive family circumstances, now, short of falling victim to random catastrophe, I think
        I have a reasonable chance to hack my way into a healthy healthspan of 100 years, a nice round number. That would be fun, I think, and something worth of a good try. Worth a good try because failing health seems quite unattractive to me, and likely more expensive, to boot.</p>

        <p>My challenge is to see what I can do in these <strong>{{ days }} days</strong> remaining until my 100th b-day. That would be about <strong>{{ weeks }} weeks</strong>, or about <strong>{{ months }} months</strong>, or roughly <strong>{{ years }} years</strong>; and which would be about <strong>{{ mars_years }} mars years</strong> (at 668.6 sols/mars year).</p>
